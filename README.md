# Google Code Jam 2020 Qualification Round

These are my solutions to three problems in the Google Code Jam programming competition of 2020. 

Each problem is contained in its own folder where the folder name corresponds to the problem name. 

Info on the individual problems can be found in the Google programming competition archives [here](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam/round/000000000019fd27). A high-level explanation of the problem can be found in each of the solution.py files as a docstring. 

All solutions are written in python and can be run via the command line with the provided input.txt files. Each problem will print out the solutions for the multiple test cases listed in the input.txt file. I have added some comments to help explain my solutions. This was done following the competition.
